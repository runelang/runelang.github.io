# Functions

Functions in RuneLang, termed as `Rituals`, are the spells you cast to conjure complex logic with simple incantations.

## Defining a Ritual

A `Ritual` in RuneLang is defined as follows:

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **RuneLang**

Looks intriguing!

```runelang
Ritual <name>() begins
  // Your magical code here
end of Ritual
```

#### **JavaScript**

Looks less intriguing!

```javascript
function <name>() {
    // JavaScript Equivalent
}
```

#### **Python**

Looks pretty boring!

```python
def <name>():
  # Python Equivalent
```

<!-- tabs:end -->
