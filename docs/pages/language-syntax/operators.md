# Operators

Valiant Adventurers use words, not math. Unless you have 10 intelligence points, but let's just ignore the rules for now.

- **is written as**: Assignment operator.
- **matches**: Equality comparison operator.
- **is**: Used for both assignment and comparison, contextually.
- **from**: Indicates the start of a range or sequence.
- **to**: Indicates the end of a range or sequence.
- **and**: Logical AND operator.
- **or**: Logical OR operator.

As simple as pi (which is pretty much just 3)!
