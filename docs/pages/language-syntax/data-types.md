## Core Data Types

- `Flagstone` represents the duality of the fates: `Truth` and `Falsehood`. It is the binary truth of the RuneLang universe, a simple yes or no, true or false.

```

### Conduit (Stream)

- `Conduit` is the flow of data, streaming like a river through the ethereal plane, never stagnant, always moving.
