# Comments

When it comes to hiding secret messages on your quests, RuneLang makes it super simple:

- `//` for single-line comments.
- `/** */` for multi-line comments.

It's practically a magic mirror from JavaScript!

#### **RuneLang**

Looks intriguing!

```runelang
/*
 *  There once was Dragon atop the mountain.
 *  He was a very strong dragon.
 *  I was stronger.
 */
```

#### **JavaScript**

Looks less intriguing!

```javascript
/*
 *  There once was Dragon atop the mountain.
 *  but Slain before I arrived.
 *  I wasn't fast enough.
 */
```

#### **Python**

Looks pretty boring!

```python
multi-line (string)

"""
I like the look of this actually.
although there isn't any real syntax
in python for multi-line comments.
"""

multi-line (singles)

# this should
# be
# illegal.
```
