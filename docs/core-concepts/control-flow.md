# Control Flow

Control the fate of your RuneLang scripts with powerful constructs that dictate the flow of your code's destiny.

## Quests

A `Quest` represents a journey of decision:

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **RuneLang**

Looks intriguing!

```runelang
Quest begins when (<condition>)
    // Victorious path
elsewise
    // Alternate fate
end of Quest
```

#### **JavaScript**

Looks less intriguing!

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // a path...
} else {
  // another path...
}
```

#### **Python**

Looks pretty boring!

```python
if condition:
    # a path...
else
    # another path...
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Loops

### Odyssey

`Odyssey` for determined repetition.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **RuneLang**

Looks intriguing!

```runelang
Odyssey for <declaration> to <condition> is
    // Repeat your chants here
end of Odyssey
```

#### **JavaScript**

Looks less intriguing!

```javascript
for (let i = declaration; i <= condition; i++) {
  // JavaScript Equivalent
}
```

#### **Python**

Looks pretty boring!

```python
for i in range(declaration, condition + 1):
    # Python Equivalent
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

### Vigil

`Vigil` for as long as the night lasts.
